    <p style="color:rgb(165, 8, 44);"> Haiiiii! I am Aloe! <strong>Bleh.</strong> I am here with my friend Biji in Girls Who Code club. We are having a challenge to speak this language you people call "English". It is quite an interesting language, and I enjoy speaking it.

    <p style="color:rgb(99, 8, 165);"> My favorite animal is a panda. Well, obviously. Just look at this adorable picture! Very cute! Am I right? </p>
    <p style="color:rgb(93, 108, 193);"> Okay, so my/our native language is actually robotinese. Yes, yes I know that that name sounds super weird, but oh yeah?! Well maybe english sounds weird? Ever thought about that? Hmmm? Sorry, I didn't mean to sound mean... Where was I? Oh yeah. There are a lot of our "icorn" friends. Such as Caticorn, (her english name is Claire) Legiticorn,(his english name is Reese) and me, Crafticorn.(my english name is Aimee by the way) All three of us are the founders of the culture of the "icorns" Yeh yeh, most people ask, "Why Reese?" Well long story short, the three of us happened to be in the same table group at the time, so yeah.

    <p style="color:rgb(10, 208, 216);"> All of my icorn friends are in the "Chinese Language Imersion Program", or CLIP program with me. It is a program in an american school where we all learn chinese! Another intersting language! Us CLIP kids pride ourselves in our ability to speak such an awesome language. But somepeople take it too far...Let's not talk about that though... some of my CLIP classmates/friends are...</p>

    <p style="color:rgb(8, 165, 159);"> You are probably wondering why this is called a roboticorn blog. Well, it all started with my five friends in fifth grade...Well, my friends and I used to constantly make random clubs. We had this one that was called â€œfluffy mountain. It was basically all of us meeting at a giant mound of dried grass. Then, I found this amazingly soft patch of clovers...heavenly...aaaaaah, so soft! Bleh, okay, focus! I looooooved that patch, so I invited my friends over. We alternated between the patch and fluffy mountain at lunch and brunch. </p>
    <p style="color:rgb(112, 240, 136);">We always hung out and ate at either the patch or fluffy moungtain. I mean <i>always</i>. One day, we kinda wanted to make another club I guess... so then we created...the one and only....Roboticorn club! Whoooo!</p> 
    <p style="color:w;">So that's the story, how and what is the roboticorn club.</p>
